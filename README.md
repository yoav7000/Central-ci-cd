# CI/CD Reusable GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows for deploying any application across development, staging, and production environments using GitOps principles. These pipelines provide a standardized CI/CD process that can be easily integrated into any project.

## Workflow Files

- **`dev-staging.yml`**: This file defines the workflow for development and staging environments.
- **`production.yml`**: This file defines the workflow for the production environment.

## Pipelines Overview

### Development and Staging Workflow (`dev-staging.yml`)
This pipeline is designed to automate the build, testing, security scanning, and deployment to development and staging environments. The steps are:

1. **Build the Docker image** for the application.
2. **Run tests** to validate the application.
3. **Trivy security scan** for vulnerabilities.
4. **Deploy to development environment** (deployment will be defined in your app repository). After a manual review, you can proceed to the next stage.
5. **Deploy to staging environment** (defined in your app repository). After a manual review, deployment to staging will proceed.

### Production Workflow (`production.yml`)
This pipeline focuses on deploying your application to production based on a Git tag release. The steps are:

1. **Build the Docker image** using the Git tag.
2. **Deploy to production environment** (deployment configuration is in your app repository).

## Required Inputs

When calling these reusable workflows in your project, you will need to provide the following inputs:

- **App Name**: The name of the application being deployed.
- **Path to the Values File**: The path to the environment-specific values file in your GitOps repository.
- **Docker Hub Username and Password**: Credentials for pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub.
- **GitOps Repo Name**: The name of the GitOps repository where the deployments are managed.
- **GitOps Repo Token**: A token that grants access to your GitOps repository for updating deployments.

## How to Use

To use these workflows in your project, simply reference the workflows from this repository in your GitHub Actions YAML file. Youâ€™ll need to pass the required inputs for each environment, ensuring your deployments follow the defined GitOps principles.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: <repo-name>/.github/workflows/dev-staging.yml@main
    with:
      app_name: <your-app-name>
      values_file: <path-to-your-values-file>
      docker_username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
      docker_password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      gitops_repo: <your-gitops-repo>
      gitops_token: ${{ secrets.GITOPS_TOKEN }}
